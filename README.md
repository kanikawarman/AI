This repository contains various projects involving advanced AI, LLM, NLP, and data science.

Project 1: le premier: LLM project with mistral 7b
Objective: This project demonstrates an article retrieval and question-answering (Q&A) system using Mistral 7b, LangChain, and ChromaDB. It leverages ChromaDB for document storage and retrieval, LangChain for chain management, and Mistral 7b as the language model for response generation, enabling efficient retrieval of articles and generation of answers based on a query.
Skills: RAG, LLM, ChromaDB, Mistral7B, Langchain

Project 2: PDF-based Q&A with Mistral7b, LangChain and Chroma
Objective: Developed an intelligent document analysis system integrating LLMs like Mistral7b and Langchain for querying PDF files, using ChromDb and RAG to enhance information accessibility and usability
Skills: RAG, LLM, ChromaDB, Mistral7B, Langchain

Project 3: Classifying embeddings using Kera
Built a text classification system with Gemini embeddings and Keras, achieving 93% accuracy. Streamlined categorization and enhanced information retrieval for scientific text, improving data management.
