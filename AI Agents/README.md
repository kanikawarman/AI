# 🧠 Building a Reasoning AI Agent with ADK & Gemini
### Developing a reasoning-capable AI agent that can autonomously plan, act, and retrieve real-time information using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini models.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **reasoning AI agent** built with **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, powered by **Gemini large language models**.  
The agent can interpret natural language queries, reason through multi-step logic, invoke tools like Google Search, and synthesize grounded, up-to-date answers.

The goal of this notebook is to **showcase end-to-end agentic AI development** — from setup and authentication to reasoning, tool orchestration, and live interaction — using production-grade coding practices.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Reasoning-Capable Agent**  
  Implements a Gemini-powered agent that decides when to rely on internal knowledge vs. external tools.

- **Tool Integration (Google Search)**  
  Demonstrates real-time information retrieval through ADK’s built-in tool interface.

- **Resilience & Reliability**  
  Includes robust retry logic, exponential backoff, and structured error handling for stable API interaction.

- **Traceable Reasoning Flow**  
  Captures the agent’s internal decision steps and tool calls for transparency and debugging.

- **Portfolio-Ready Output**  
  Produces clean, human-readable responses suitable for demonstrations or applications.
