architectures, it’s essential to configure a reliable development environment.\nThis section establishes the foundational components for building, coordinating, and testing agentic AI systems using **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.\n\n### **1.1 — Install Dependencies**\n\n**🧠 Conceptual Insight**\nThe **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is Google’s production-grade framework for building autonomous and collaborative AI agents.\nUnlike raw LLM API access, ADK abstracts orchestration, memory, and tool-calling layers into composable components, enabling developers to scale from single-agent prototypes to coordinated multi-agent systems.\n\n**🔧 Implementation Notes**\nKaggle Notebooks already include the pre-installed **`google-adk`** library and its dependencies, so no additional installation steps are required for this environment.\n\nFor external or local development, ADK can be installed via PyPI:\n\n```bash\npip install google-adk\n```\n\n**🔍 Engineering Rationale**\nDependency isolation and version control are critical for **reproducibility and system reliability**—especially in multi-agent ecosystems where orchestration logic and model versions must remain synchronized.\nMaintaining a consistent ADK environment ensures that agent behaviors, coordination protocols, and evaluation metrics remain deterministic across experiments and deployments.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **1.2 — Configure Gemini API Authentication**\n\nTo enable the agentic workflows in this notebook, we need to authenticate access to **Google’s Gemini API** — the model foundation for all reasoning and orchestration tasks.\n\n**🔐 Purpose & Context**\nThe **Gemini API** powers the intelligence layer of each agent.\nProper authentication ensures that all API calls are secure, rate-limited, and compliant with Google Cloud’s authorization protocols.\nThis setup step mirrors standard practices used in production environments where credentials are stored securely and never hard-coded.\n\n**🧩 Implementation Workflow**\n\n1. **Generate an API Key**\n\n   * Visit the [Google AI Studio → API

While flexible, this approach can be unreliable — a large language model may skip steps, reorder actions, or over-optimize a response path.\nWhen workflows depend on precise, ordered task execution, prompt-based sequencing alone is insufficient.\n\n**The Solution: A Deterministic Pipeline**\n\nTo enforce predictable execution order, we introduce the SequentialAgent, which functions like an assembly line.\nEach sub-agent performs a well-defined operation, and its output automatically feeds into the next stage.

What if you could break down complex problems into smaller, smarter, and more collaborative pieces? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a powerful paradigm that's transforming how we build software, offering unprecedented flexibility, scalability, and problem-solving capabilities.\n\nMAS fundamentally changes your approach to development by embracing **specialization**. Instead of one giant program, you have individual \"agents,\" each a master of a specific task. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy means developers can focus on optimizing individual agents, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code and a significantly reduced cognitive load.\n\nBut the real magic happens when these agents **collaborate**. By defining how they communicate and cooperate, complex, intelligent behaviors can emerge, much like a digital hive mind. This collaborative nature fosters dynamic problem-solving, where agents can negotiate and adapt in real-time. Plus, if one agent stumbles, others can often compensate, making your system more resilient and robust.\n\nThe benefits extend to **scalability and flexibility**. MAS promotes a modular architecture, making it a breeze to add, remove, or update agents without toppling the whole system. This modularity, coupled with the potential for parallel processing, means your software can grow and adapt to changing demands without becoming a tangled mess.\n\nFinally, MAS unlocks **enhanced intelligence and autonomy**. Agents can make independent decisions, and by integrating machine learning, they can even learn and adapt over time. This opens doors to building sophisticated, autonomous applications and powerful simulation environments. It’s time to embrace the collaborative power of intelligent agents and build the next generation of software.\nEditorAgent > ## Level Up Your Code: Why Multi-Agent Systems Are Your Next Big Developer Superpower\n\nAre you weary of wrestling with monolithic codebases that feel like an insurmountable tangle? Imagine, instead, breaking down complex challenges into smaller, smarter, and more collaborative components. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a powerful paradigm that's revolutionizing software development by offering unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and problem-solving prowess.\n\nMAS fundamentally reshapes your development approach through **specialization**. Instead of a single, all-encompassing program, you work with individual \"agents,\" each a specialist in a specific task. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy allows developers to focus on optimizing individual agents, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code and a significantly lighter cognitive load.\n\nThe true innovation, however, emerges when these agents **collaborate**. By defining clear protocols for communication and cooperation, sophisticated, intelligent behaviors can spontaneously arise, akin to a digital hive mind. This collaborative framework enables dynamic problem-solving, where agents can negotiate, share information, and adapt their strategies in real-time. Furthermore, if one agent encounters an issue, others can often step in to compensate, making your system inherently more resilient and robust.\n\nThe advantages of MAS extend to **scalability and flexibility**. The paradigm naturally lends itself to a modular architecture, simplifying the process of adding, removing, or updating agents without destabilizing the entire system. This modularity, combined with the potential for parallel processing, allows your software to grow and adapt seamlessly to evolving demands, preventing the dreaded \"tangled mess\" scenario.\n\nLastly, MAS unlocks **enhanced intelligence and autonomy**. Agents can be empowered to make independent decisions, and when integrated with machine learning, they can even learn and evolve over time. This opens exciting avenues for creating sophisticated, autonomous applications and powerful simulation environments. It's time to embrace the collaborative strength of intelligent agents and build the next generation of software.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## 🛣️ Section 4: Parallel Workflows - Independent Researchers\n\n**The Problem: Sequential Bottleneck**\n\nSequential pipelines guarantee order and determinism, but they can become inefficient when handling independent subtasks.\nFor example, if an AI system needs to research three unrelated topics — technology, healthcare, and finance — running them sequentially forces each step to wait for the previous one, even though there’s no dependency between them.\nThis creates latency bottlenecks and underutilizes available computational resources.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution with ParallelAgent**\n\nWhen multiple tasks can be executed independently, the optimal solution is parallel orchestration.\nThe ParallelAgent enables concurrent execution of multiple sub-agents — each focusing on its own specialized domain — and then aggregates their results once all tasks complete.\n\nThis approach:\n\n- Maximizes throughput by eliminating idle waiting time.\n- Preserves task isolation so that one agent’s delay or failure doesn’t block others.\n- Allows for scalable performance gains in both latency-sensitive and distributed systems.\n\n**When to Use Parallel Patterns**\n\nAdopt a ParallelAgent when:\n\n- Tasks are independent (no shared state or dependencies).\n- Speed and resource utilization are critical.\n- You plan to aggregate results after simultaneous execution.\n\nTypical use cases include:\n\n- Multi-topic research\n- Multi-document summarization\n- Batch data labeling\n- Ensemble decision-making\n\n**Architecture: Multi-Topic Research**\n\nThe diagram below illustrates a research system where three domain-specific agents operate concurrently, with an aggregator agent compiling their findings into a unified report.\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"User Request: Research 3 topics\"] -- > B[\"Parallel Execution\"]\n    B -- > C[\"Tech Researcher\"]\n    B -- > D[\"Health Researcher\"]\n    B -- > E[\"Finance Researcher\"]\n\n    C -- > F[\"Aggregator\"]\n    D -- > F\n    E -- > F\n    F -- > G[\"Combined Report\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffffcc\n    style F fill:#ffccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/parallel-agent.png\" alt=\"Parallel Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1 Example: Parallel Multi-Topic Research\n\nThis example demonstrates how to design a multi-agent research system where multiple specialized agents operate concurrently, each focusing on a different domain.\nA final Aggregator Agent then synthesizes the collective insights into a single executive summary.\nThis architecture models real-world use cases like market research dashboards, multi-domain reporting, or ensemble reasoning.\n\n1. **Tech Researcher** - Researches AI/ML news and trends\n2. **Health Researcher** - Researches recent medical news and trends\n3. **Finance Researcher** - Researches finance and fintech news and trends\n4. **Aggregator Agent** - Combines all research findings into a single summary","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**System Design**\n\n**Objective:**\nExecute three independent research agents (Technology, Health, Finance) in parallel and then combine their findings into a unified summary.\n\n**Architecture:**\n**1️⃣ Parallel Phase:**\n\n- Tech, Health, and Finance researchers operate concurrently.\n- Each writes to a shared state key (tech_research, health_research, finance_research).\n- \n**2️⃣ Aggregation Phase:**\n\nOnce all research agents finish, the AggregatorAgent compiles the findings into an executive summary.\n\n**3️⃣ Top-Level Control:**\n\nA SequentialAgent orchestrates the two phases: Parallel research → Aggregation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1: Define Specialized Research Agents**\n\nEach sub-agent focuses on a single domain and uses the google_search tool to retrieve real-time insights.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tech Researcher: Focuses on AI and ML trends.\ntech_researcher = Agent(\n    name=\"TechResearcher\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Research the latest AI/ML trends.

The result: static output with no learning loop.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement with LoopAgent**\n\nThe LoopAgent introduces a feedback-based improvement cycle.\nIt repeatedly executes a set of sub-agents until a termination condition (such as “quality approved” or “max iterations reached”) is satisfied.\n\nThis pattern transforms the workflow into a self-improving system, enabling agents to:\n\n- Generate → Evaluate → Revise → Repeat.\n- Enhance quality with each iteration.\n- Apply structured self-critique for higher accuracy and polish.\n\n**When to Use Loop Architectures**\n\nUse a LoopAgent when:\n\n- The task benefits from iterative feedback (e.g., writing, design, reasoning chains).\n- Quality control and self-correction are more valuable than single-pass speed.\n- You want adaptive improvement through a review–refine cycle.\n\nCommon use cases include:\n\n- Story or article refinement\n- Code review and bug correction loops\n- Response grading and regeneration\n- Creative ideation or brainstorming sessions\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\nThis architecture models a writer–critic dynamic, where the system alternates between generating content and reviewing it.\nThe LoopAgent manages repeated exchanges until the output reaches acceptable quality or the iteration limit is reached.\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example:Iterative Story Refinement (Writer ↔ Critic Loop)\n\n**Objective**\n\nDemonstrate a self-improving generation loop where a Writer drafts a short story and a Critic evaluates it, feeding structured feedback back to the Writer until quality criteria are met or a max-iteration cap is reached.\n\n**Loop Pattern**\nWriter → Critic → (approve?

However, here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's character and motivations:** While his thirty years in the lighthouse are established, give the reader a glimpse into what Elias *wants* or *dreams of*. Is he content with his solitary life, or does he harbor a secret longing for adventure or something more? This would make his reaction to the map more impactful. For example, you could add a sentence about how he often gazed at the stars, wondering what lay beyond his predictable world, making the celestial map even more compelling for him.\n\n2.  **Enhance the description of the map and its discovery:** The description of the map is evocative, but the discovery itself could be more visceral. Instead of \"amongst the seaweed and driftwood,\" consider making the discovery more specific or even dangerous. Did he have to brave the storm to find it? Was it tangled in something specific that made him notice it? For instance, \"A rogue wave had deposited a chaotic jumble of debris at the base of the tower, and as Elias surveyed the damage, a glint of blue caught his eye amidst the kelp – a tightly rolled cylinder, unexpectedly heavy.\"\n\n3.  **Create more immediate intrigue around the map's origin or purpose:** The map being \"for somewhere far beyond the horizon\" is a great hook. To enhance this, you could subtly hint at *why* it appeared now, or what the pulsing star might signify. Is there any symbol on the map that Elias recognizes, however faintly, or a recurring motif that feels significant? Even a fleeting thought or question from Elias could add layers. For example, as the lines glow, Elias might wonder, \"Was this the path to the stars he'd only ever seen from his lonely perch?\"\nRefinerAgent > Elias trimmed the lamp, the familiar scent of whale oil clinging to the air. For thirty years, the rhythm of the sea and the creak of the tower had been his world.
